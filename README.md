# Event Calendar

## Synopsis
Event Calendar is an app that is targeted towards people looking for events in the area. How it works:  
 * Search events based on location, date, and type of event
 * Once search is complete the page will populate with five events that meet the search criteria with the option of searching through more events if the user desires
 * User will have the ability to click on the event picture to see a dropdown that will include a brief Yelp description and a few recent reviews
   * If the event is music related, Soundcloud will provide a sample of the music
 * User will be able to add an event to their calendar and/or add the event to their favorites
 * User profile page will include a calendar of all events they have added and a favorites board that will show any events that the user has favorited
 * Users will be able to delete, drag and drop (edit), and view events including event details on their calendar
 * User can share an event to their Facebook wall
